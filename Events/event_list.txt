# IMPORTANT: the lines 'selected run IDs = *' and '#START' are required.
# Accepted key word in params:
#  map, which specifies the filename of the magnetogram
#  pfss, which specifies the PFSS solver, either HARMONICS or FDIPS
#  time, which specifies the start time of the simulation
#  model, which specifies the module used, either AWSoM or AWSoMR. AWSoM and AWSoMR could not be selected at the same time.
#  realization, which specifies the realization for ADAPT maps. The format is similar as run IDs.
#  add, which specifies any command to be turned on. This requires that the command is already in the PARAM.in/FDIPS.in/HARMONICS.in.
#  	And it can turn on multiple commands (separated by comma, NO SPACE IN BWTWEEN), e.g., add=HARMONICSFILE,HARMONICSGRID
#  rm, which specifies any command to be turned off. This requires that the command is already in the PARAM.in/FDIPS.in/HARMONICS.in.
#  	And it can turn off multiple commands (separated by comma, NO SPACE IN BWTWEEN), e.g., rm=HARMONICSFILE,HARMONICSGRID
#  any one command from the PARAM.in file (case sensitive), e.g., UnitB, StochasticExponent.
#      No space between the command and the value.
#
# Choose the run IDs, can be multiple IDs, e.g., 1,3,4,5-10,16
selected run IDs = 1,3
