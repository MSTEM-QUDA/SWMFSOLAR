This repository contains scripts, param files and input files for running
AWSoM and AWSoM-R models. The param files in this repository mean PARAM.in, 
HARMONICS.in and FDIPS.in files. The input files mean the magneotgram files.

The SWMFSOLAR directory must be linked to an installed SWMF source code
directory and have access to the SWMF's Makefile.def file.

The Events directory contains some previous simulations, and associated param 
and input files.

The Param directory contains the latest param files.

The Scripts directory contains some Python scripts to change the param files.

USAGE:
To use SWMFSOLAR, first install the SWMF in the usual manner. Then enter the
SWMFSOLAR directory and type

make install

to install SWMFSOLAR (basically links all Python scripts in various places).

make help

to see the available options.

To submit multiple runs with the event_list:
Copy Events/event_list.txt to the SWMFSOLAR main directory, 
and modify it based on your need.
More information on editing and parameter options is listed within 
"Events/event_list.txt" .
Copy all the magnetogram files (corresponding to the selected events 
in events_list.txt) to the SWMFSOLAR main directory.
Execute "Scripts/sub_runs.py" to run the selected runs.

To be continued.
